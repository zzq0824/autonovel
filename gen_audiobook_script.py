Parse novel chapters into speaker-attributed audiobook scripts.

For each chapter, uses Claude to:
  - Identify every dialogue line and its speaker
  - Tag narration as NARRATOR
  - Add [audio tags] for emotional delivery based on context

Usage:
  python gen_audiobook_script.py           # All chapters
  python gen_audiobook_script.py 1         # Single chapter
  python gen_audiobook_script.py 1 5       # Range of chapters

    "PERIN": "26, Cass's brother. Dry, precise, carries something heavy. Letters-voice is more controlled than in-person voice.",
    "LENNE": "14, female. Quick, confident, intellectually sharp. Composes while she talks — fingers moving, voice certain.",
    "TORVALD": "63, retired dye merchant. Gravelly, warm, rambling. Outer-district speech — longer sentences, less careful, trade metaphors.",
    "MARET": "60, female. Controlled, precise, still. No wasted words. When she finally shows emotion it's devastating.",
    "DAV_SORN": "34, Court Singer. Formal, clipped, self-correcting. Starts sentences and abandons them. Qualifying everything.",
    "PROCTOR_FEN": "Male, middle-aged, Academy teacher. Dry, archly amused, pedagogical.",

    "MIRA_FEN": "60s, female, Academy scholar. Quiet, precise, carrying thirty years of regret.",

AUDIO_TAG_GUIDE = """
Available ElevenLabs v3 audio tags (use sparingly, only when the emotion is CLEAR):

Emotions: [happy] [sad] [angry] [excited] [nervous] [calm] [worried] [frustrated] [hopeful] [tense]
Delivery: [whisper] [softly] [firmly] [hesitantly] [sarcastically] [matter-of-factly] [gently]
Reactions: [gasp] [sigh] [laughs] [clears throat]
Volume: [quietly] [loudly]
Pacing: [slowly] [quickly] [pause]

Rules:
- Narration: use tags VERY sparingly. Mostly just read it straight. Use [softly] for tender moments, [slowly] for revelations, [tense] for suspense.
- Dialogue: use tags to match the speaker's emotional state in context. A worried father sounds different from an angry teenager.
- Don't over-tag. One tag per segment is usually enough. None is fine for neutral delivery.
- [pause] before revelations or after devastating lines.
- [whisper] for secrets, locked-room scenes, late-night moments.

CHARACTERS IN THIS NOVEL:
{json.dumps(CHARACTERS, indent=2)}

AUDIO TAG GUIDE:
{AUDIO_TAG_GUIDE}

RULES:
1. Every piece of text must be attributed to a speaker. Narration = "NARRATOR".
2. Dialogue lines must be attributed to the character who speaks them.
3. Remove quotation marks from dialogue — the voice actor performs them.
4. Keep narration segments reasonably sized (2-4 sentences each). Split long paragraphs.
5. Dialogue "he said" / "she said" tags should be part of the NARRATOR segment AFTER the dialogue, not part of the character's line.
6. Scene breaks (---) become {{"speaker": "NARRATOR", "text": "[pause]"}}
7. Chapter titles become the first segment: {{"speaker": "NARRATOR", "text": "[slowly] Chapter One: The Morning Pitch"}}
8. Add audio tags based on emotional context. Be subtle — most lines need no tag.
9. Internal thoughts in *italics* should be read by the CHARACTER (Cass usually), tagged [softly] or [whisper].

OUTPUT FORMAT: A JSON array of objects, each with:
  "speaker": character name (from the list above)
  "text": the text to speak (with optional [audio tags] at the start)

CHAPTER {ch_num}: "{title}" ({wc} words)
