a complete premise you could build a novel from.

For EACH concept, provide:

NUMBER. TITLE (a working title, evocative, not generic)
HOOK: One sentence that would make someone pick up the book. Specific
  and surprising, not "In a world where..."
WORLD: What makes this world different? Not just "there's magic" but
  what specific, unusual thing defines this place? Be concrete --
  salt flats, inverted towers, cities that migrate, a sea that
  remembers, whatever. Make it SENSORY.
MAGIC/COST: What is the core speculative element and what does it
  COST? Per Sanderson's Second Law, limitations > powers. The cost
  should create interesting dilemmas.
TENSION: What's the central conflict? It must be both PERSONAL (one
  character's specific problem) and COSMIC (affects the world).
  These two must be in tension with each other.
THEME: What question does this story explore? Not a message -- a
  genuine question with no easy answer.
WHY IT'S NOT GENERIC: One sentence on what makes this different from
  standard fantasy fare.

Aim for DIVERSITY across the {count} concepts:
  - At least one with a non-human-centric world
  - At least one that's more literary/quiet than epic
  - At least one with an unusual narrative structure idea
  - At least one set outside the typical European-inspired setting
  - Mix of tones: dark, warm, weird, melancholy, whimsical

DO NOT generate:
  - Chosen one prophecies (unless subverted in an interesting way)
  - Dark lord / ultimate evil as the main antagonist
  - Medieval Europe + elves/dwarves/orcs
  - "Academy" or "school for magic" settings
  - Love triangles as the central plot

RIFF_PROMPT = """I have a seed idea for a fantasy novel:

"{idea}"

Generate 5 variations on this concept. Keep what's interesting about
the core idea but push it in different directions. For each variation:

NUMBER. TITLE
HOOK: One sentence.
HOW IT DIFFERS: What did you change from the original seed and why?
WORLD: Concrete, sensory world details.
MAGIC/COST: The speculative element and its cost.
TENSION: Personal + cosmic conflict.
THEME: The question it explores.

Make the variations genuinely different from each other -- don't just
tweak surface details. Change the protagonist, the setting, the tone,
the structure, the thematic focus.
