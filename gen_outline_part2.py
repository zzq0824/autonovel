The outline was cut off mid-chapter-17. Continue from where it left off, then complete chapters 18-24,
then write the Foreshadowing Ledger.

THE OUTLINE SO FAR:
{part1}

THE CENTRAL MYSTERY (for reference):
{mystery}

REMAINING STRUCTURE NEEDED:

Ch 17 (complete it): Maret confrontation -- she reveals the truth about the void
Ch 18: Dark Night of the Soul -- Cass processes what he's learned
Ch 19: Break Into Three -- new information or perspective changes everything  
Ch 20-21: Gathering forces, making a plan
Ch 22: The climax at the Bell Tower -- Cass answers the question
Ch 23: Aftermath and resolution
Ch 24: Final Image (mirror of Opening Image)

Then write:

## Foreshadowing Ledger

| # | Thread | Planted (Ch) | Reinforced (Ch) | Payoff (Ch) | Type |
|---|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|------|

Include at LEAST 15 threads. Types: object, dialogue, action, symbolic, structural.
Plant-to-payoff distance must be at least 3 chapters.

REMEMBER:
- The climax uses the fourth option: Cass amplifies the question into audible range
  so the city can hear and answer for themselves
- This doesn't free Perin directly (Stability Trap -- not everything resolves cleanly)
- Cass's lie must be fully shattered by the climax
- Final Image should mirror Ch 1's Opening Image but show transformation
- At least one quiet chapter in the back half
