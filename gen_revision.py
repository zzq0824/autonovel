REVISION BRIEF (follow this exactly):

VOICE DEFINITION:
{voice}

CHARACTER REGISTRY:
{characters}

WORLD BIBLE:
{world}

PREVIOUS CHAPTER ENDING (maintain continuity):
{prev_tail}

NEXT CHAPTER OPENING (end so this flows into it):
{next_head}

THE EXISTING DRAFT (use as raw material -- keep what works, cut what doesn't):
{old_text}

ANTI-PATTERN RULES:
- NO triadic sensory lists (X. Y. Z.)
- NO "He did not [verb]" more than once
- NO "He thought about [X]" constructions
- NO "the way [X] did [Y]" more than twice
- NO "not X, but Y" formula in narration
- NO over-explaining after showing
- MAX 2 section breaks
- At least one moment that genuinely surprises
- 70%+ in-scene (dialogue and action, not summary)
- Dialogue should sound like speech, not prose
