~80,000 words total (~3,000-4,000 words per chapter).

SEED CONCEPT:
{seed}

THE CENTRAL MYSTERY (author's eyes only -- reader discovers gradually):
{mystery}

WORLD BIBLE:
{world}

CHARACTER REGISTRY:
{characters}

VOICE (tone and register):
{voice_part2}

CRAFT REFERENCE (structures to follow):

BUILD THE OUTLINE WITH:

## Act Structure
Map out Act I (0-23%), Act II Part 1 (23-50%), Act II Part 2 (50-77%), Act III (77-100%).
State the percentage marks for the key novel.

## Chapter-by-Chapter Outline

For EACH chapter, provide:
### Ch N: [Title]
- **POV:** (always Cass, third-person limited)
- **Location:** Which districts/locations
- **Save the Cat beat:** Which beat this chapter serves (Opening Image, Setup, Catalyst, etc.)
- **% mark:** Where this falls in the novel
- **Emotional arc:** Starting emotion → ending emotion
- **Try-fail cycle:** Yes-but / No-and / No-but / Yes-and
- **Beats:** 3-5 specific scene beats that must happen
- **Plants:** Foreshadowing elements planted in this chapter
- **Payoffs:** Foreshadowing elements that pay off here
- **Character movement:** What changes for Cass (or other characters) by chapter's end
- **The lie:** How Cass's lie ("if I master the system, I can fix things from inside") is
  reinforced or challenged in this chapter
- **~Word count target:** for pacing

## Foreshadowing Ledger

A table tracking every planted thread:
| Thread | Planted (Ch) | Reinforced (Ch) | Payoff (Ch) | Type |

Include at LEAST 15 threads. Types: object, dialogue, action, symbolic, structural.

KEY PLOT ARCHITECTURE:

Act I (Ch 1-6ish): Establish Cass's world, his pain, his gift, the Academy, his family.
Plant the mystery early (the locked room, the forbidden bells, father's tremor).
Catalyst: something forces Cass to investigate Perin's contract.

Act II Part 1 (Ch 7-12ish): Investigation. Cass digs into the Corda contract, encounters
Maret, allies with Torvald and Lenne, begins hearing the harmonic more clearly.
Midpoint: Cass learns a partial truth that changes his approach (false victory or defeat).

Act II Part 2 (Ch 13-18ish): Pressure mounts. Maret moves against the Bellwrights.
Father's secrets begin to surface. Cass's lie is increasingly unsustainable.
All Is Lost: Cass confronts his father and learns the full truth.

Act III (Ch 19-24ish): Cass understands the question. Must choose how to answer.
The climax plays out using the established intervals of Tonal Law.
The resolution shows the aftermath of his choice.

CONSTRAINTS:
- The climax must be mechanically resolvable using established Tonal Law intervals
- Cass's investigation should feel like a mystery plot overlaid on a coming-of-age arc
- The Stability Trap: bad things must stay bad. Not everything resolves cleanly.
- Perin must appear in person at some point (not just in memory/letters)
- At least 3 chapters should be "quiet" -- character-focused, low-action, emotionally rich
- Vary the try-fail types: 60%+ should be "yes-but" or "no-and"
- The foreshadowing ledger must have plant-to-payoff distances of at least 3 chapters
