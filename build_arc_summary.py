PREMISE: In Cantamura, a city where law is sung into binding through
specific musical intervals, 14-year-old Cass Bellwright can hear when
someone is lying -- a quarter-tone between F and F-sharp that causes
him physical pain. His older brother Perin has been bound to service
in the House of Corda for 10 years through a contract their father
allowed. The bells their family maintains contain a secret: a question
("Do you consent to be bound?") embedded in the sub-harmonics by the
city's founder 200 years ago. No one has ever heard it. No one has
ever answered. Every binding in Cantamura is technically void.
