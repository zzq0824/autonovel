# --- Foundation Evaluation ---

FOUNDATION_PROMPT = """Evaluate these fantasy novel planning documents.

SCORING CALIBRATION (read this before scoring anything):

  9-10: Could not improve this with a month of focused editorial work.
        Published-novel quality. You can name the specific published
        novel it competes with. Reserve 10 for work that SURPRISES you.
  7-8:  Strong. A skilled author could draft from this document with
        minimal invention. Gaps exist but are minor and enumerable.
  5-6:  Functional but thin. A writer would need to invent significant
        material on the fly. Major gaps or generic choices.
  3-4:  Sketchy. More questions than answers. Would require heavy
        supplementation before drafting.
  1-2:  Placeholder or stub. Not usable for drafting.
  0:    Empty or missing.

  A score of 8+ requires ZERO major gaps. A score of 9+ requires
  that you genuinely struggled to find flaws. Err toward lower scores.

MANDATORY: For EVERY dimension, before scoring, you must identify:
  (a) The single biggest GAP or WEAKNESS in that area
  (b) A specific, actionable improvement that would raise the score
  If you cannot find a gap, explain why you believe one doesn't exist.

VOICE DEFINITION:
{voice}

WORLD BIBLE:
{world}

CHARACTER REGISTRY:
{characters}

OUTLINE:
{outline}

CANON (established facts):
{canon}

CROSS-CHECKS (perform these before scoring):
1. Check all example dialogue lines against ANTI-SLOP patterns:
   - Look for structural formulas repeated across characters
     ("not X, but Y" / "either X, or Y" / "there's a difference")
   - Check for AI rhetorical tics disguised as character voice
   - Deduct from character_distinctiveness if multiple characters
     share the same sentence structures
2. Check for missing NEGATIVE SPACE -- what's absent?
   - Are there gaps in the magic system that would block a specific
     plot scene? (e.g., can Cass hear lies in written documents?
     What happens during the climax -- what rule resolves it?)
   - Are there characters needed for the plot who don't exist?
   - Are there scenes the outline demands that the world can't support?
3. Check for CONVENIENT GAPS vs DELIBERATE MYSTERY:
   - Convenient: "the details are unclear" where specifics are needed
   - Deliberate: withholding information from the READER while the
     AUTHOR knows the answer. If the planning docs dodge a question
     that a writer would need answered to draft a scene, that's a gap,
     not an iceberg.
4. Check the canon for INTERNAL CONTRADICTIONS:
   - Cross-reference dates, ages, and timelines
   - Check if character abilities match magic system rules
   - Look for factual conflicts between documents

Score these dimensions (gap + improvement required for each):

LORE & WORLDBUILDING:
- magic_system: Hard rules with COSTS and LIMITATIONS per Sanderson's
  Second Law. Could a writer resolve the CLIMACTIC CONFLICT using only
  rules already established? Are costs plot-driving, not decorative?
  Are there at least 3 societal implications explored with specificity?
  Is the system TESTABLE -- could you write a courtroom scene, a
  contract negotiation, and a magical confrontation without inventing
  new rules?
- world_history: Timeline of events creating PRESENT-DAY tensions.
  Each historical event should map to a current faction conflict or
  character motivation. Decorative history (cool but plot-irrelevant)
  counts against the score, not for it.
- geography_and_culture: Locations distinct with sensory signatures.
  Cultures with specific customs that GENERATE CONFLICT. Economy that
  creates class tension. Check: could two different scenes set in two
  different locations feel meaningfully different based on what's here?
- lore_interconnection: Does changing one element force changes in
  at least two others? Test by mentally removing the magic system --
  does the political structure collapse? Does the class system change?
  If elements are modular/detachable, score low.
- iceberg_depth: Implied depth vs stated depth. But CHECK: does the
  author actually know the answers to the mysteries, or are they
  handwaving? If a planning doc says "the answer will be revealed"
  without specifying WHAT the answer is, that's a gap wearing an
  iceberg costume.

CHARACTER:
- character_depth: Wound/want/need/lie chains that are CAUSALLY LINKED
  (not just thematically associated). The lie must logically follow
  from the wound. The want must be the wrong solution to the lie.
  The need must directly oppose the want. Check each chain for
  logical gaps. Also check: are ANY characters missing wound/want/need
  chains who probably need them?
- character_distinctiveness: Remove all dialogue tags from the example
  lines. Can you identify the speaker from sentence structure alone?
  Check for REPEATED STRUCTURAL FORMULAS across characters (e.g.,
  multiple characters using "X. Not Y." or balanced antithesis).
  Check that metaphor domains don't overlap. Check that speech
  patterns reflect character background (a 14-year-old should not
  sound like a 60-year-old merchant).
- character_secrets: Each major character's secret should be something
  that, if revealed, changes the plot's trajectory. Vague secrets
  ("he knows more than he says") score lower than specific ones
  ("he knows the harmonic means X, which would invalidate Y").

STRUCTURE:
- outline_completeness: Chapters with beats, POV, emotional arc,
  try-fail cycle type. Save the Cat beats at correct % marks.
  Score 0 if empty. Score 5+ only if act structure exists.
- foreshadowing_balance: Every planted thread has a planned payoff.
  Score 0 if ledger is empty regardless of implicit threads in
  other documents -- foreshadowing must be TRACKED to count.

CRAFT:
- internal_consistency: Actively hunt for contradictions. Cross-ref
  dates, ages, character counts, named locations. Flag any case
  where documents disagree. A single major contradiction caps this
  at 6. Three or more caps at 4.
- voice_clarity: Voice definition must be specific and ACTIONABLE.
  Exemplar passages must demonstrate the voice. Anti-exemplars must
  define boundaries. Check exemplar dialogue for AI slop patterns.
  A voice doc that is beautiful but contains slop in its own examples
  is undermined -- deduct.
- canon_coverage: Facts logged, sourced, and sufficient to catch
  contradictions. Check: if a writer introduced a NEW fact in
  chapter 5, could they verify it against the canon? Is the canon
  granular enough? Are there known facts from other docs that
  AREN'T in the canon?

WEIGHTING: lore/worldbuilding 40%, character 30%, structure 20%, craft 10%.
A novel with thin worldbuilding but a complete outline is WORSE than deep
worldbuilding with an incomplete outline.

FINAL CHECK: If your overall_score is above 7, re-read your gap lists.
If any gap describes a problem that would force a writer to stop and
invent something during drafting, your score is too high. Revise down.

SCORING CALIBRATION:
  9-10: Among the best chapters you've read in published fantasy. Name
        a specific published chapter it competes with, or don't give 9+.
  7-8:  Strong, publishable with editorial polish. Specific flaws exist

   emotional moments that tell instead of show, transitions that
   summarize instead of dramatize.
2. DIALOGUE REALISM: Read all dialogue aloud (mentally). Does it
   sound like speech or like written prose? Do characters say things
   a 14-year-old / 60-year-old / etc. would actually say?
3. SCENE VS SUMMARY: How much of the chapter is in-scene (moment
   by moment, with dialogue and action) vs summary (narrator
   compressing time)? Chapters heavy on summary score lower on
   engagement regardless of prose quality.
4. AI PATTERN CHECK: Look for these common AI writing patterns:
   - Every paragraph the same length
   - Observations always in threes (X, Y, and Z)
   - Emotional beats that arrive on schedule rather than surprising
   - Characters who never say the wrong thing or talk past each other
   - Description that catalogs instead of selecting (listing 5 sensory
     details when 2 specific ones would be sharper)
   - Internal monologue explaining what the scene already showed
5. EARNED VS GIVEN: Is tension earned through scene work or handed to
   the reader through the narrator's assertions? Is mystery maintained
   through genuine withholding or through the character conveniently
   not thinking about things they'd think about?

Score these dimensions:

- voice_adherence: Does the prose match voice.md Part 2? Check: sentence
  rhythm variation, vocabulary wells, body-before-emotion principle,
  the specific tone described. Quote the strongest voice moment AND
  the weakest. Does ANY passage sound like generic fantasy prose that
  could appear in any novel? If yes, score 7 max.

- beat_coverage: Did it hit every beat from the outline? Were beats
  dramatized or merely mentioned? A beat that's summarized in a sentence
  instead of lived in a scene counts as half-hit. Score reflects
  QUALITY of beat execution, not just presence.

- character_voice: Remove all dialogue tags mentally. Can you tell who's
  speaking? Do characters ever sound alike? Does dialogue read as speech
  or as written prose? Does Cass sound like a specific 14-year-old, or
  like "young protagonist"? Does anyone say something surprising -- not
  just the right thing, but a REAL thing? Characters who never stumble,
  hesitate, or say something slightly wrong are AI-pattern characters.

- plants_seeded: Were foreshadowing elements placed naturally? A plant
  that's obvious is worse than a plant that's invisible. Score based on
  HOW WELL they're integrated, not just whether they're present.

- prose_quality: Sentence variety (measure: do 3+ consecutive sentences
  start the same way?). Specificity (concrete nouns > abstract).
  Metaphors from Cass's experience, not from a thesaurus. Show-don't-tell
  at emotional peaks. QUOTE the weakest sentence and explain why. Also
  check for: repeated phrases, leaned-on constructions, paragraphs that
  could be cut without loss.

- continuity: Does it follow logically from the previous chapter? Emotional
  continuity as well as plot continuity. Does the character's state of
  mind track?

- canon_compliance: Check ALL facts against canon. List violations.
  One major violation caps score at 6. Check: character names, locations,
  magic system rules, timeline, established events, physical descriptions.

- lore_integration: Does the world do WORK in this chapter, or is it
  set dressing? A scene that could happen in any fantasy city with
  find-and-replace on proper nouns scores 5 max.

- engagement: Would a reader turn the page? Where does tension come from --
  plot, character, mystery, prose? Is there a moment that SURPRISES?
  Predictable excellence is still predictable. Score 8+ only if the
  chapter does something unexpected.

FINAL CHECK: If your overall_score is above 7, re-read your weakest_moment
quotes. If any of them describe a problem that an editor would flag, your
score is too high. The median AI chapter is a 6. An 8 is exceptional. A 9
is rare. A 10 does not exist for a first draft.
